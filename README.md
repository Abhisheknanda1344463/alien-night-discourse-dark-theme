# Dark Theme "Alien Night Theme" for Discourse

I wanna share a dark discourse theme I created for my [empyrion forum](https://forum.empyrion-homeworld.net).
It should be a combination of a dark space with the main color green and secondary color orange.

## Installation

As seen in the screenshot follow the 0-5 steps. Then paste following CSS either in the Desktop view or Mobile view.

## Theme for Desktop 
### CSS 
https://github.com/B-iggy/discourse-dark-theme/blob/master/theme-switcher--desktop.css

### HTML

## Theme for Mobile 
### CSS 
https://github.com/B-iggy/discourse-dark-theme/blob/master/theme-switcher--mobile.css

### HTML 
https://github.com/B-iggy/discourse-dark-theme/blob/master/theme-switcher--mobile.html

## Additional feature: Theme Switcher
Initially I build a theme switcher at the top right where people can choose between a Light and this Dark theme.
I set a global modifier class in the html and store it in their localStorage. 
This way it is permanent and can react properly.
